I want to do another pass on this some day and make it smoother but for now: 

I made this for me, it is not as fully polished for release as I would like it to be. 

Print at your own risk. 

I recommend taking a close look at the files and understanding how the default kit goes together. 

Changes include, but are not limited to:

1. Springs instead of elastic. A spring not in the hardware kit is required for the mag release and it is hard to install. 
2. Toy screws not in the kit are required to attach a cover above the grip. 
3. I removed some nuts, this has more screws going into plastic than the original. 
4. Only takes katana mags, tighter fitting magwell, one mag release paddle. 
5. Probably more I can't remember.
