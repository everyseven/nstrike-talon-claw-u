I want to do another pass on this some day and make it smoother but for now: 

I made this for me, it is not as fully polished for release as I would like it to be. 

Print at your own risk. 

I recommend taking a close look at the files and understanding how the default kit goes together. 

Changes include, but are not limited to:

1. Pump grip has chunks of low frinction machining plastic bolted to it that run in the U channels. I don't have instructions for these yet.
2. Springs instead of elastic. A spring not in the hardware kit is required for the mag release and it is hard to install. 
3. Toy screws not in the kit are required to attach a cover above the grip. 
4. I removed some nuts, this has more screws going into plastic than the original. 
5. Only takes katana mags, tighter fitting magwell, one mag release paddle. 
6. I tightened up some tolerances. I can't guarantee your print quality/ hardware will fit. There are no gaps in front of my rails, yours might be slightly different.
7. There's a sharp corner on one of the partial hexagonal nut holes. I shaved off IRL, I will round it in software for the next version.  
8. Probably more I can't remember
